		<h1 style="font-family: candara; font-size: 45px";><i>MSI G66 Stealth</i></h1>
		
		<h2 style="font-family: candara">A Sturdier, But Plainer, Look</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 18px";>The build of the GS66 Stealth is markedly different from the GS65. At a glance, the two look the same, but they <br>diverge in size, feel, and color scheme. Starting with the aesthetics, MSI opted for an all-black look here, ditching<br>the gold accentson the lid, vents, and touchpad. Although, the gold scheme, looked sharp and stood out from <br>others, but this sandblasted <b>"Core Black"</b> look has a wider appeal and can blend in in more professional settings.<br><br>Physically, the build is a lot sturdier this time around, and just slightly thicker. Vendors have seemed to realize that<br> the performance and feature gains provided by an extra tenth of an inch or so outweigh the benefits of an<br> imperceptibly thinner design. <b>The GS66 Stealth measures 0.71 by 14.2 by 9.7 inches</b><br><br></p>
		<figure><img src="Reviews\msi1.jpg"><figcaption style="font-family: candara; font-size: 14px";>Sturdiest one from MSI!</figcaption></figure><br><br>
		
		<p style="font-size: 18px";>MSI doubled down on the sturdiness with the GS66, both with reinforcements to the chassis and an overall blockier <br>shape. There is virtually no flex in the chassis and makes it feel much more solid overall. <br> That comes at a cost of slightly more weight, but not as much. The GS65 weighed in at 4.4 pounds, while the GS66<br>weighs 4.63 pounds. It's a measurable difference, and you can feel it, but the gain is slightly less considering the<br>improvement in the build. With the additional weight and sturdier build, it has an added heft that makes it that much <br>less portable.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2 style="font-family: candara">The New 300Hz Display</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 18px";>It's a 15.6-inch panel with full HD or 1080p resolution, which is normal enough. The real head-turner is the <b>300Hz</b><br>refresh rate, far higher than the increasingly common 144Hz rate and the already sky-high 240Hz panels. This means<br>the laptop can display up to 300 frames per second (fps), which roughly translates to how smooth a game will look in<br>motion. That's five times the 60Hz refresh rate of most laptop panels, so this is quite a leap.
		<figure><img src="Reviews\msi2.jpg"><figcaption style="font-family: candara; font-size: 14px";>Stunning Bezel-less Display!</figcaption></figure><br></p>
		<p style="font-size: 18px";>	
		As for the rest of the build it's good, but not remarkable. The keyboard is designed in concert with SteelSeries and <br>features customizable per-key lighting. The keys are responsive, but a little shallow for my liking—it feels like you're<br> hitting bottom quickly, giving a flat sensation, particularly with the space bar. Still, it's mostly good enough, and the<br> touchpad, it's a bit wider than average, which is nice, and tracks smoothly.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2 style="font-family: candara">Ports, Configurations, and Component Concerns</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 18px";>
		The chassis includes plenty of physical connections, including one USB-C port with Thunderbolt 3, three USB 3.1 <br>Type-A ports, and an HDMI port. The thicker chassis also allows it to include an Ethernet jack, a boon to gamers.<br>For $2,699, you get the 300Hz display, as well as an Intel Core i7-10750H processor, 32GB of memory, the Nvidia <br>GeForce RTX 2080 Super (Max-Q) GPU, and a 512GB solid-state drive. Other versions span from $1,499 to $2,999,<br> with CPU choices going up to the Core i9-10980HK and GPU options running down to the RTX 2060. There are 1TB<br>SSD options too, which might be smarter buys: Because 512GB is a bit cramped for modern games.

		<h2 style="font-family: candara;">A Powerful, Pricey Machine</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 18px";>
		The MSI GS66 Stealth is a strong contender in this field, with a nice build and high-end features that match its high<br>price. It's a wholly different proposition from the GS65, which was a much less expensive configuration—and was <br>also a lighter, slimmer machine, with a few more unique features to separate it from the pack.<br> <br>This laptop has less of an identity than its predecessor. It's a reasonably portable, high-performing machine, but the<br> design is more run-of-the-mill, and the performance, while great, isn't quite what we expected considering the GPU.<br>

		Don't get it wrong, though: The GS66 Stealth has plenty of advanced features and will perform at very high frame<br> rates in all games. Even if the design is more standard, it's still good quality, and the fancy extras like the 300Hz screen<br> will leave some salivating. The price tag is quite high, though, and the storage capacity is a bit low for gaming. I can<br> only recommend it to hardcore enthusiasts with big budgets, but they likely won't be disappointed. The <b>Asus ROG <br>Zephyrus G14</b> is our most recent gaming laptop Editors' Choice for its tremendous value, and the <b>ROG Zephyrus S</b><br> GX502 is our reigning premium pick.
