		<h2 style="font-family: candara">Two Main Models, One New Keyboard</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 18px";>

			A controversial keyboard once present on every Apple laptop is now a thing of the past. The new-for-2020 13-inch <br>MacBook Pro was the last Mac notebook waiting to be updated with the new Magic Keyboard. Apple sells two main <br> configurations of the 13-inch MacBook Pro. Physically, they’re nearly identical. Both of them have the new Magic <br>Keyboard and a thin touch-enabled mini-screen forward of the keyboard called the Touch Bar.<br> They also share the same dimensions: 0.61 by 12 by 8.4 inches (HWD) and 3.1 pounds. The main way you can tell <br>them apart from the outside is by the number of ports. The entry-level ($1,299) configuration has just <br>two USB Type-C ports on the left side, while the upgraded $1,799 version reviewed here offers an additional two<br> USB Type-C connectors on the right, for a total of four.<br><br> On the inside, the differences are more significant. <br>The entry-level configuration uses the same 8th Generation Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processors that powered the <br>previous 2019 version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro. Meanwhile, our review unit features an improved 10th<br> Generation "Ice Lake" processor, available in either Core i5 or Core i7 variants. In addition to a new CPU design, the <br>10th Generation chips also bring other benefits, like faster graphics processing and memory, which are unavailable <br>on the entry-level MacBook Pro.

			Some feaures are trivial, like the Touch Bar. This tiny touch screen replaces the row of function keys, but the<br> functionality it offers depends greatly upon the app you’re using. Some apps, like the Safari web browser and Adobe<br> Photoshop, make extensive use of the Touch Bar, while many other apps offer no Touch Bar support, however, in<br> which case the Touch Bar just serves as a way to control basic functions like system volume and screen brightness.

		<p style="font-size: 18px";>

		Frequent users of the Escape key will appreciate that the new Magic Keyboard has reclaimed this vital key from the<br> Touch Bar. There’s now a physical Escape key located to the left of the Touch Bar, instead of a virtual one built into the<br> Touch Bar like on previous versions of the MacBook Pro.<br><br>

		Overall, though, the presence of the Touch Bar isn’t a key reason to choose the MacBook Pro over the MacBook Air.<br><br>

		The processor differences between the Air and the Pro are more significant. The entry-level MacBook Air has a 10th <br> Generation quad-core Core i5 with a base clock speed of just 1.1GHz and a power consumption of 10 watts.<br> (More power available to the CPU typically increases performance, all else being equal.) Even though the entry-level <br>13-inch MacBook Pro has an older 8th Generation Core i5 with the same number of cores, its 1.4GHz clock speed is <br>higher, and so is its 15-watt power consumption. Stepping up to the Core i5 in our review unit gets you an even better<br> 10th Generation Core i5 that’s more powerful than the one in the MacBook Air, with a 2GHz base clock speed.

		<h2 style="font-family: candara">As Ever, Sharp: The Retina Display</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 18px";>
		 Retina Display. It’s a 13.3-inch panel with a very high native resolution, somewhere between full HD and 4K. <br>(It measures 2,560 by 1,600 pixels.) Colors appear brilliant, and text is sharp, and I especially like the True Tone feature,<br> which optimizes the white balance of the screen for the nature of the ambient light around the laptop.

		<p style="font-size: 18px";>
			Upgrading the MacBook Pro to a 10th Generation Core i7 costs an additional $200. You can also upgrade the memory <br>and storage amounts, all the way up to 32GB of memory and a 4TB SSD. The upgrades reduce the value proposition<br> even further, with a maxed-out configuration ringing up at $3,600.
			Even though it lacks a Core i7, MacBook Pro <br>benchmarks well compared with the MacBook Air, the 2019 entry-level MacBook Pro with the 8th Generation Core i5,<br> the Razer Blade Stealth, and the Dell XPS 13.
